#########################################

#     You do not need to modify this code. This is the main simulation,
# which sets up the system, runs it, and graphs it. You will write the
# functions that govern the physics of the system in air_resistance_solution.py
#
#     You may modify this code; doing so may yield interesting results,
# but for the simulation to run, you must complete the template in the
# the solution file. This will be an important reference and should help you
# figure out what each function is responsible for.

# INCLUDE THE CODE YOU WILL WRITE #######

                 title = "RED y-velocity vs. time")

# visualize ground in the simulation:
# [hint: this is similar to setting up the sphere in air_resistance_funcs]
ground = box(pos = (0,0,0), size = (15,0.1,100), color = color.green)


# INITIALIZE OBJECTS ####################

# DISCRETIZE SYSTEM #####################

# SIMULATE THROUGH TIME #################

# [hint: look in here for examples of function calls]

    # calculate forces

    # [hint: notice how a ball's y-axis velocity is accessed]
