# air_resistance.py

# original code by Byron Philhour
# modified by Raewyn Duvall & John C. Merfeld

# TODO

# primary:
# build boilerplate code appropriately
# update drag coefficient to accurately take area into account
# 
# secondary:
# ensure that air resistance is discussed, the key concept being that it is
#   dependent on velocity
# this code is probably the most intuitive way to understand it, really. We 
#   need to facilitate that
# starting by thowing them up might be more useful than bouncing, as it
#   reveals other interesting features of the problem
# side-by-side comparison of b = 0 and b > 0 cases
